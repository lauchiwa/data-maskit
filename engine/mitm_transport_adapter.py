"""Read-only mitmproxy transport observation, isolated behind a version contract.

P1 deliberately stops at the feasibility gate. ``reuse=False`` does not exclude
an already connected context server; pending establishment is shared, and tunneled
TLS connections do not necessarily own a ConnectionHandler transport. Neither
header injection, flow.kill(), nor changing connection.error is a safe substitute
for targeted transport control. No transport, header, body, or retry is modified.
